# Legacy compat patch
This mod is a legacy compatibility patch for Exotic Industries < 0.6.0, to add support for Krastorio 2.

## Why legacy?
Exotic Industries 0.6.0 added compatibility with Krastorio 2. I have updated and maintained this patch mod, originally developed by VELTAX, so that players who have already started a playthough with the previous iterations of this mod can continue to completion.

It is necessary to do that, because the compatibility added to Exotic Industries for Krastorio 2 offers a slightly different late-gamplay experience than this patch provides. Therefore, in the interest of supporting players who are working through the progression of EI <= 0.5.9 with previous versions of this patch, I have provided this.
